Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is a genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People can get a certain disease because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagonosed with certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing frightening times in our family 's later lives .
When people around us know we have a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether it 's caring about us too much or keeping away from us .
And both are not what we want , since most of us just want to live as normal people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are too distracted to worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole lives , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb '' will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways that can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through the process from the scope of the whole family .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members that have this disease .
Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
"
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If a certain genetic disease test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others , it is okay to disclose the result .
Above all , life is more important than secrets .
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
After all , what affects one family may or may not affect another , although the families have a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing it , or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the individual moral system .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entirely sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parent - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousins .
This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurrently has a knowledge about that of others .
This knowledge maybe relavant to them ; and vice versa .
An example that may serve as an illustration , is breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
Does one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret or inform their relatives ?
In retrospect , its is also one 's duty to ensure that he or she will undergo periodic health checks .
Sometimes , some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from , the son or daughter for example , the parents who know about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring at risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information , as they may not want to know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) , nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extends 'vertically ' .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the person 's morals and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
People with a close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her family members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the corresponding flows .
In my opinion , although the annoyance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Focus on the negative side of the annoyance of genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it a secret , as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance to carry a certain disease .
Especially for the young people without marriage , if they 're known to have some genetic risk , it may seem certain that their child would carry the same disease , but it 's not certain .
Therefore , keeping the information secret from a future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , announcing the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue and although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear some potential disease in the future , causing them to go to the hospital , do additional checks or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease -- and this creates unnecessary costs for the family .
Furthermore , the announcement of genetic risk would affect the relationships of some relatives since some may not want to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance of getting the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
First , for the case of marrige , people should be honest and tell his/her spouse that they may carry certain genetic risks that may affect their offsprings .
It is better to let the other party know the fact , than after the baby is born , and certain type of genetic disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk to have diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candy and chocolate to prevent the intake to much sugar , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future because of related genes. They can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with diabetes in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweighs the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Genetic disorders may or may not be hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases .
It is a long time discussion whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by gene .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
We ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem .
It is immoral and impractical .
First , someone having some kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
Privacy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
If the law requires someone to tell others his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so .
It is againt his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
The law 's spirit also include fairness .
What is the basic difference between a genetic disorder and other disorders ?
It is unfair to release a law only pointing to the genetic disorder .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute .
However , there are many problems again the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her relatives the cause of his or her diseases .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
If you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such disease .
How can a law made by government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potetial disease ?
However , from the ethical point of view .
To the carrier himself of herself , he or she should have a feeling of responsiblity to tell his or her relatives of their genetic disorder .
By doing this , they may be able to save some of the lives of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with bad genes may not necessarily have those genetic diseases , if they can have a corresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function becomes stronger .
A typical example is genetic caused hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension .
People usually get this kind of hypertension after they become an adult .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push a genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem .
By doing so , less of his or her loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo .
It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might be a chance for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
But , if it is a terminal genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some said that the genetic risk found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered personal , confidential information .
Most patients will be depressed after learning of their condition .
After the test , one might not want to inform relatives as it could discomfit the entire extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves , hoping to ensure they are n't the source of any family negativity .
Furthermore , some will concentrate on not becoming a burden to anyone , since seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some see it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidence .
On the other hand , others may think that it would be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to take some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases , given the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realized in the early stage .
Hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's inherited medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue leading a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
All in all , it depends on the individual and also on the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it .
Genetic testing is a personal decision , with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even if there is no risk at all .
Early examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk-carrier , there should be a choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
They should not be forced or obligated to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the carrier of the gene .
With regard to the choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or child , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to put into the immediate family , as it could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members themselves .
Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives , since it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital , as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder .
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and to similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about the outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that such a genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it has been made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and background of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easy to be awarded by his or her families .
When it come to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
As a result , in the case when one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or abnormal , he or she should be aware whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid , the parent will be informed by the medics for sure , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition .
On the contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his own choice to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that would be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Think of it the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilemma .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger .
The reason behind that is , after WWII , the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to create more births .
During that period , if one of the family members exhibits genetic disorder symptoms , he will fel trapped in an ethical dilemma , for sure .
The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
With a potential genetic risk , he has to choose whether to protect his family or create more prosperity for them .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be forever mined .
This is kind of an ethical issue and can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully of the consequences of telling relatives his or her generic disorder .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to grow the family .
Regardless , if the disorder is to be fatal , or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
One of the reasons why is because , as a carrier , people need mental support to get through the situation .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on their own .
By telling his or her family , in addition to being a support , they can possibly help her get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support for the carrier .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform family , since other family member might experience the same thing .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves .
I find that it is important to inform , especially if it is contagious. The carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society .
For every action , there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members , as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable , or even feel ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden her family .
I can understand the feelings of the carrier .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether this negative effect will happen when the carrier decides to tell his or her family about his or her condition .
In conclusion , personally , I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest about his or her feelings , and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on in his or her life .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
True enough that there are lots of cancer patients who were given second choice to live as a normal person as they have a strong mental support from their loved one .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
As technology has been advancing , it has reached a stage where the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual use of the technology .
Genetic testing has been made possible - it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I belive that he or she has right not to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly brighter , but the carrier , before testing , can choose not to test , simply live with unknowns and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that and it has been something 'normal ' to everyone in the past before genetic testing was possible .
It could instead be better for them this way .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention against giving birth to the disabled and making them suffer in real life .
I personally think this is the purpose of genetic testing , so a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid can choose against giving birth to the child and making the entire family suffer .
However , I belive that the carrier has right not to obligate to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
If the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth .
I belive that even the carrier has the right to know the true facts .
After realizing the he or she is the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem due to the fact that it creates more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and take appropriate action to the results .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilt can be more than expected and could be a burden on the mind for the rest of the life .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years , should a carrier for a known genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that is worth discussing .
This is an issue needs to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
In this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in the support of view for any carrier of that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
We were crying hard but we are not alone , it 's our family and relatives that mature us .
Hence , they should be the people we are grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy with .
However , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it may seem no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing of bad news .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
As the case of health issues is related to genetic risk , with the keyword being " genetic '' which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree that it 's an obligation for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives. This will help avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raised in the future .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issue or to bear it within him/herself , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risks .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risks .
On top of that , the genetic risk may pass down to next generation ; thus it will involve more than just one family .
I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and planning a family .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the stance of informing the relatives once the results of the test are known .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
The benefits of doing so outweigh its disadvantages .
More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at such a junction as to whether him/her should inform the relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is the common law in the society .
However , it leads to a new problem ; " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ? ''
This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is still a diversity of point of views among the people .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issues , which is : " should or should not '' .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk '' .
Frequently , the intention of the carriers is to not tell their families ; in order to continue their own life without the anxiousness of their families .
It is obvious that it will be better for one person to be worried than many .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges themselves .
With the family 's support , there will surely be more energy to fight against the demon .
The demon is not easily defeated and it requires much energy and psychological support .
Families give you the courage and support you ca n't get for yourself .
That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Besides that , the risk of the known gene is very serious that it can not be described .
The magnitude can be larger than our imagination .
Lying on the bed for the remaining life and even passing immediately , these are some of the consequences which we can not imagine .
Families are our dearest in our life .
Without their concern and support , we can hardly stay until this time .
They play the important role in our life which can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk can also critically affect our next generation .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier .
It is the ethical responsibility of hospital staff to protect patient privacy .
We can not blame them if they 're subject to the undesired consequences .
However , hospitals can provide counselors to advise the carrier about action that can be taken .
Therefore , this kind of circumstance will not happen again and again .
It is a method that benefits two parties , which is a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to define .
Thus , advice from the hospital plays an important role in this .
Carrier is responsible to balance their own interest against the benefits to family and even society .
It is a hard decision to make but in the most appropriate way , it will create significant future circumstances for the carrier and family .
With the risk of discovering a genetic disorder , many individuals have decided to undergo genetic testing .
Given that results will be known once the tests are done , each individual diagnosed as a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical problem : should they warn their relatives about the risk of having the same genetic risk ?
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell relatives , for the following reasons .
First of all , from the angle of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell others .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of invasion of privacy to carriers .
They may not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and not let others know about it .
This is reasonable , since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated against by others , which is not a positive factor brought to their life .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can approach a doctor about it .
If they do n't want to think too much of it and view it as a problem , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher risk of being genetic risk carriers .
This obeys their own willingness , as they have to accept the truth , which may make their subsequent existence miserable .
Many people argue that setting the obligation may help relatives of the carriers , making it more likely to save their lives because of the early diagnosis .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors -- including psychological and social influence -- are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told they may have higher risk of getting sick , they may have be scared about the unknown ; partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave ; and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether to tell relatives or not .
This should be accepted from the point of human rights , freedom of acceptance of relatives , as well as many other social reasons .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and create a lot of confusion for their relatives .
For a carrier of genetic disorder to know they are a carrier , it causes a greater dilemma than getting the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell relatives .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy about sharing their problems regarding genetic disorders .
Firstly , the carrier and their family can take precautions physically to reduce the chance of it being passed on to offspring and mentally if the actions fail to prevent it from being passed on .
Many syndromes such as Down syndrome and Taylor syndrome can be prevented if the mother receives proper medication and does n't consume harmful items during the pregnancy period .
This information may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives regarding her condition .
The more people ( relatives ) who know her problem , the more information channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome , then the family has to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parent 's fault because there is still a chance of the gene being inherited .
So they also have to prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases are costly for treatment and medication .
Albinism is one of such example .
People with albinism have sensitive skin and need regular treatment .
Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their body well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen outdoors , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive .
To prevent the bigger problem from happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care for your body .
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is sickle cell trait .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problem such as blood blocking .
If the parents know one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to relatives , then they can have their children undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy about it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Fourth , it is important for parents to provide a mental boost for their children with a genetic disorder .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
People and friends often mock one 's conditions .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and from the closest ones .
If not their family then who else is willing to do that ?
It is not a difficult job for family if they 've first prepared mentally by disclosing the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
In this modern world , compared to last century , technology is much improved .
Particularly in the medical field , there is great improvement in treatment for many formerly incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods used to diagnose an individual 's risk for genetic disorders .
Medical authorities claimed that only the individual at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell relatives .
This is because relatives have the right to know .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives : that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder , and it means that other family members also have almost an equal risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with him- or herself .
If they do not know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their right ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James , about this .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , James should know what will be likely to happen to him .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having a similar genetic disorder , helping prevent certain genetic disorders from affecting them .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvements in medical treatment make it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or reduce the negative effects of the disorder personally .
In addition , doctors usually quote a statement , " Prevention is worth a pound of cure , " which means preventing a problem is more advantageous than curing it .
Awareness of a genetic disorder may help an individual 's diagnosis , and therefore make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People aware of having such disorders can prevent them by adapting a healthy lifestyle , including a balanced diet and at least 30 minutes exercise every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell relatives .
This is their human right to know , and this may also save lives by preventing the disorder from occurring .
Together with the advancement of technology over past decades , medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are constantly happening. Doctors empowered with advance medical knowledge are able to diagnose and perform genetic testing for patients to help them take necessary steps to protect their life. However , once a test has been conducted and results are known , the question of disclosing results to relatives becomes a challenging issue for both doctor and patient. In my opinion , I strongly support a patient 's obligation to inform relatives .
As it is a genetic risk , the patient 's next-of-kin might have a high chance of carrying the risk , hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances occur. For example , if you are the only child in a family and you are suffering from a genetic disease , the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child. By letting your family members be aware of the situation , it would lessen family stresses on forcing you to settle down and have children. However , social ethical issues like discrimination and privacy are big concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients ' relatives. It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles. Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives ; it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members. Early disclosure to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention , as in the case of Angelina Jolie ; she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer to under five percent. I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story : she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
However , there are still people against the decision of revealing private information. As in the case of Alzheimer patients , it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information. However , research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who , how and to whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimize potential negative impact to families ' members ( DementiaToday , 2012 ) . There are associations that provide help to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association , 1980 ) . Although there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving support from everyone , the need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is help that patients need in their difficult time .
In conclusion , the state should have passed a bill to measure and provide information to doctors that will be extended should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to the patient 's decision. In addition , the state could also be encouraged to create assistance schemes to give necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of themselves and family members. Although it may face challenges from ethical issues , in the long term , with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government , more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measures to protect their own health and the health of their loved ones .
Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .
Not long ago , the Human Genome Project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) was started .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , in which the technology is very mature already , an even more popular topic arises .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the patients who are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
Take H1N1 as an example. All the people in Singapore , including students at school , travelers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office , as well as passengers on the street , are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and instead , place their loved ones in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other with no doubts .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder , both as a social responsibility and a favor to preserve the family structure .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , a patient 's life is no better than death .
Family members , as one the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort , are a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of the genetic disorder .
A 2010 New York University study has shown that patients with family members around them generally recover 2-4 days faster than those taken care of by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panic which will endanger the family harmony .
While every family needs to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members , as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other , all these troubles are just tests to make them stronger .
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , what does n't kill you make you stronger .
Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
Nevertheless , while I fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird ' .
This is because many genetic diseases are related , such as Bubble-Boy Disease , Autism , or Down Syndrome .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics , compared to those without the genetic diseases .
While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a RISK of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and , therefore , it is normal for people to try to keep some of their personal issues to themselves , in case some people judge them or treat them differently. Many people hear only what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person suffers from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I feel it is up to the person whether they want to share the information since family members might be paranoid , judge him and/or act differently .
Especially when just a risk , the option really is theirs since they 're not an actual sufferer .
Some people may say it 's necessary to tell family members about the risk , as some of them may be affected. That 's a good point. However , how much trust one has in their family members concerning matters such as this is also important .
Maybe one can trust immediate family but what about extended family ?
Furthermore , since genetic risk and genetic disease is a very personal issue , it is up to the individual whether or not to tell relatives .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since the genetic risk may affect his children later .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and , therefore , they should not have any children since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born .
Or , in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters : therefore , although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right of it .
He may have different considerations other than the judgment of other people , or it may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
Genetic risk refers the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have a genetic risk .
One of the reasons that parents should be informed is they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk .
The child with a genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to contribute to the family as others can , and most of the time they are not accepted by the majority .
They may not able to enjoy a normal life people can enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work endlessly , longer than expected , to foster their child if they 're not able to foster themselves .
The situation may become worse if the child has an illness like cancer or heart disease , which means parents have more heavy baggage , namely medication fees .
Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that 's not able to work and may suffer pain their entire life .
The other reason that parents should know their baby is a carrier of genetic risk is for the nation 's good .
There are always newspaper reports that a newborn baby has been abandoned at the hospital after parents realize the baby has diseases that need a huge amount of money to treat .
For countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled , such as medical subsidies and special schools .
Without increasing the number of disabled in a nation , the government is able to concentrate on developing in other ways , like military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world we are living in today , many miscarriages occur in hospitals every day .
It is easier for people to accept morally .
Therefore , I believe parents have the right to know the health of their child .
Many individuals -- especially religious people -- may support this with the theory that everyone has a right to enjoy the world .
However , the problem is will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday , with all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what is best for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have been informed .
Also , human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy from happening .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
One should have full control of their information and it is their right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else .
As far as I 'm concerned , when a couple are going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether they could have some genetic diseases .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wives .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that relatives are at high risk for these diseases .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling them the result can help them greatly reduce the cost for multiple testing .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of contracting this disease .
If person has disease C that might be a result of gene A .
He runs a test and know that he has the gene AA .
This means both parents have gene A and are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C , if he runs a test and know that he has the gene A .
This means one of his parents has gene A and the expense of one test could be spared .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can somehow be prevented , to stop it from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved through personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives : if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hint or encourage certain relatives to run a gene test , if they are concerned about negative consequences that come across when they disclose their genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that some might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
If a person is obliged to tell his or her relatives , he or she might be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advised to not get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene A and gene A is sufficient for a very serious disease .
After he takes the test and is obliged to tell his relatives , everyone knows that he is a carrier .
So all the married couples are tested and know they are not carriers. They might subconsciously see him differently and worry he will find a wife carrying this gene as well .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
If a gene runs in the family and one of the family members tests positive , whom does he need to tell ?
If that is a big family , is he obliged to tell everyone ?
Spouses usually have very close relationships , if person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousin has this disease .
However wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
In less than a week half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and his family might be a genetically risked family .
Then nobody wants to marry A or his relatives .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his/her information , especially when the party that he is obliged to disclose his information to is a potentially large group ( relatives ) .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Nowadays , people not only pursue the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations .
Since the technology of modern society has advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decisions to take genetic tests so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risks , which can affect their next generation .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is " are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ? ''
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
There are two basic reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives , and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
The awareness of your relatives and families about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellness and your relatives ' health .
If you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is great possibility that your relatives ( like parents or siblings ) are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's not certain what will happen to both you and your relatives .
However , if you have undergone and know that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert , avoiding getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do checks regularly .
Therefore , telling families and relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
As a parent , you 're not being responsible to future generations , since you 're knowingly allowing genetic risk to be passed on by generation after generation .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a choice about whether or not to have a child .
And if you still decide to have a baby , since technology has advanced so dramatically , it might be possible in the future that the application of the altering gene is perfected and widely used. You can then choose to give birth to babies with a brighter future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing genetic testing in the first place .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and are aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
To tell or not to tell .
Consider a case : we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the result of it .
We found that we actually are the genetic risk carrier .
Then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life .
As a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives if we really care about their health status .
For example , diabetes is a genetic disease .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugary food to keep a good mood .
It is important for those young people .
The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will keep for the rest of their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic tests as well to see whether they are carrying it or not , which is also better for them .
However , some people may argue : why do we want to interfere with their lives ?
Sometimes , it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease ( like blood disease ) which is untreatable .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on everything .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct , which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing. So actually it is creating trouble for them .
Personally I feel that we still should honor our responsibility to tell them the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is try to make a positive .
We can not let it go .
We should know that , although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid having their baby carry this genetic risk as well .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones , and we need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell .
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused extensive controversy .
Some say it is an invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
They have the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell relatives about their actual situation .
This essay will illustrate two aspects .
First of all , it can be an alert for family members of the patient and make them aware of the possible disease they may also have .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetics , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble and save much time for proper treatment .
Sometimes lives may even be saved , if they are told early and conduct timely treatment .
So , for the consideration of the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
They need to ask for a doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
Some genetic issues will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are the opposite .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may be at risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a real story in the newspaper years ago .
A couple in China had a son of 5 years old .
Their son unfortunately fell ill , and he was diagnosed with a kind of genetic disease that is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder , and could pass it only to boys , rather than girls .
Therefore , their son inherited the genetic disease .
However , the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage , and she did not tell her husband .
The son died after one year 's treatment , and the couple got divorced later after that .
If the wife had not hid the truth and asked for doctor 's advice before they had a baby , the tragic would not have happened .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have , and they can perform treatment in time , if possible .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do genetic testing .
We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people when they face the disorder problem .
However , I thought that genetic information is one person 's personal information which should be protected by the law .
Therefore , I thought a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
As follows , there are three reasons .
First , the genetic information is something personal , which is also private , like people 's bank card-keys .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission , even when they are his or her relatives .
The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy .
People 's genetic information should not be told to other people .
They may know the person 's potential disease or other bad things .
They may set a bias on this person , even leading to his or her abandonment .
People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought of badly because of bad genes .
So I think that whatever the genes are or whether the gene matches their parents , it should not be told to anyone , even his or her family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family , even breaking the relationship between children and adults .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them .
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier that would appear which will gradually destroy the family .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children : meanwhile , they feel happy in the company of the children .
The children rely on the parents to live .
When they grow up , they take care of their parents and thank them for their dedication .
The relationship between parents and children is about love and dedication .
Nobody wants to see a broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives without the person 's permission .
Finally , the technology of genetic testing is not mature .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life .
Therefore , I think a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives
More and more illnesses are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of the medical technology .
People will know whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done the genetic test .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
However , not everybody is so lucky , so they make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible enough to tell their relatives .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from one family and own the same forefather , then , of course , they own some of the same genes .
Therefore , there is nothing to be shy or afraid of .
If the person tells their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to the hospital to check whether they also have a disease gene .
Then , the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring .
Also , they can prevent the disease from going to their offspring .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help. They will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or she did not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that the disease gene is carried .
Then , they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
There is a story I watched on TV .
A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time , and their parents were anxious about it ; they asked them to go to hospital to check what was the problem .
After coming back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene so that they can not have a baby .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce her husband .
After he got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it stated that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
At that time , the woman knows how much her husband loved her , but she ruined her happiness .
Tears showed nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they are born with .
However , they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family members bond closely , also many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
However , there rises a family-related ethical dilemma : if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted , and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Then , they are unable to have a suitable method of protecting themselves and being emotionally prepared .
Taking Angeline Jolie , for example : she is famous , but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk .
Everything is not that bad , if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also somehow related to the others ' risk .
However , I believe it is just the usual reaction to this situation .
In addition , though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in their employment and social life , how can people face more dramatic tragedy , such as sickness or death , if they can not even overcome this harsh situation ?
Life is hard , but people can not blame it for being unfair .
It is just because you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , and you feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever , but when it is revealed , it will be more shocking and upsetting .
As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives to tell that genetic testing is needed .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other , as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of society and anxiety about the risks .
To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about genetic testing results for the good of their health .
It can be very difficult for them , but necessary for the carriers and their families .
In addition , emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition are also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives , and , if necessary , to guide them if he/she wish to conduct similar genetic testing .
The Impact Of Social Media .
Social media has been playing a vital , important role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible for us to keep way from it .
I started getting involved with Facebook one year ago , when I just arrived in Singapore .
And now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with hundreds of seeds every day .
We know each others ' statuses , changes , and so on through social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send SMS to that individual any longer .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform them of this kind of change .
If you are not on it , you will just get lost .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us a lot of convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking through the phone since it is free .
We discuss everything we like and we also have more personal space. Our friends also have more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
Also , we get a chance to talk to public figures ( like popular stars ) and get to know their lives better .
In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , like firefighters , police stations , and so on .
Social media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
And actually , lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media , like looking for people who get lost and so on .
With more convenient and humanitarian communications , the relationship between government and people gets largely improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social media .
We can know more news and cultures through social media .
From this scope , social media has shortened our distance .
However , we get fewer chances and give less importance to talking face-to-face since social media is so convenient , advanced , and interesting .
And even when we gather together , more people find themselves having fewer topics to talk about than before , and choose to dig from their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it as if we are in front of each other ; sometimes when we are by each others ' side , we seem to be farther than far away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship not as stable , secure and reliable than before .
Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
To some extent , this makes our lives more luxurious and blundering .
For myself , I long to go to some places after I see those beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes , I even can not sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our life patten so fast , and leaves us less time to think about our life .
Social media is becoming more important , and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills , require practice .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint , but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information can be readily available for their perusal .
This improves the connectivity between the users .
For example , one is able to send notifications and other information we used to have in hard copy previously over the web , and the process takes seconds .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately , depending on the quality of the network .
This convenience can be perceived almost in real time .
Next , communications are also greatly improved .
In the past , vast communications were done by one of the many , such as telegrams , snail mail , and poor-quality voice calls .
With the welcoming of applications such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase off most of the olden days communication methods .
Aside from hearing the voice , a web camera could also be affixed to emulate a 'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media .
However , it is a good practice not to intensively use social media all the time .
Intimate interaction is greatly lacking in social media interactions , particularly the touch .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utilizes the motor , thinking , and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for proper interpersonal relations .
It is also entirely incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skill .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people , and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skill on its own - some have it , some do not .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance with utilized tests , and ranked .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower rankings for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when these skills are needed .
Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , and friends .
The types of uses must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion , and others .
The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use of social media is justified .
For those who live within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communication with each other .
At the same time , it improves interpersonal skills , through dynamic practice between individuals and real-time presence .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media helped people to have closer connections with each other , it is also a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared to face-to-face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face-to-face contact and thus does not negatively affect interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts among people .
First , social media networks have a large user base , and it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
In the days without social networks , people may not have had the chance to know others from different countries or ones they never met before .
The number of people that they know was limited to the people they met in daily life , like classmates and working partners .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never knew before , and this helps to develop interpersonal skills , as well .
Secondly , although social networks take time for people to chat online but not face-to-face , they may still decide on a time online to meet others face-to-face in daily life .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .
For example , if the social network does not exist , the business people need to meet each other face-to-face , and it is time-consuming - although sometimes with business that is not so important , it still takes a lot of time on travel , which is a wastage .
However , social networks help people to meet and chat much more easier ; they can even use video chat , and create group chats to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants , as it saves time and cost .
The social network may also create some negative impacts for the people .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on the internet every minute .
They take too much time using online social networks , and , thus , do not have time to have their daily meetings with people in their real life .
It not only affects the interpersonal skills , but is also bad for people 's health if they spend too much time on the social media .
Secondly , social networks may leak certain personal information to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe ; people may not protect their privacy online effectively , and , sometimes , some people may use others ' personal information to deceive .
In conclusion , the unsafe online environment and spending too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using social networks .
It provides people with a more convenient environment and improves the frequency of meeting with each other .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than costs .
The world is increasingly becoming flat by all kinds of social network websites , such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who lives thousands of miles away eats for lunch though these kinds of social media sites .
From some points of view , social media really has a lot of advantages by letting us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ignored when you consider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime .
Social network sites provide us many conveniences .
Without hanging out with friends , or talking with friends on the phone , we can know his of her latest news by scanning the webpage .
It can help us know more about each other .
It can make people become closer as well .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singers is Justin Bieber through facebook , you can give him or her Justin Bieber 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet , and you two will surely become closer .
In addition , social network sites can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without Facebook , we may have lost contact .
However , thanks to Facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing , as we live close to each other .
The disadvantages of social media are undeniable .
Research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thoughts when they say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those " nice '' guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her , but just communicate with friends on Facebook .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other , but just look at their cellphones .
This kind of behaviour is not good for people 's psychological health , according to research .
The cyber communication is quite different to face to face communication , and people who depend on cyber communication too much will not get used to real life communication .
In addition , cyber relationships can not always work in real life .
With no close relationship in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more possible to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others using our five senses .
With the willingness of people to become the best among others , social network sites now become a place to show off .
Some people will to post their expensive things or the overseas places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
It is a mental unhealth , and it may trigger people , especially teenagers , to become material .
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is convenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Above all , social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it , such as putting less personal information on his or her facebook page .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than never before .
Today , social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are relatively common within the contemporary society ; people can communicate with each other on these social networking platforms .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people , as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and downsides of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media users are able to disseminate information faster than any other format .
There are about 50 % of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made them easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated is reliable .
There might be false information or hoaxes spread around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This caused panic among people who flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and it temporarily closed the schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat , given that social media can disseminate information relatively quickly .
Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes from spreading .
There will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites , despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Social media users are able to improve relationships and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends and it took a relatively long time to send the letter .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other at their convenience .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends and find those who have similar interests or hobbies .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other , as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties .
But , if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve their relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be taken care of .
All-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more advancements to come in the future .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly eased long-distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenience .
With a globalized and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platforms for social interaction .
With just a touch from any media/electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with friends without hassle .
Thus , long distance relationships or friendships can be maintained and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made easier .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of statuses of one 's personal feelings or experiences , and the ability to reply to these posts , human interactions are expanded with ease .
Introverts , or those who are too shy to communicate with their friends , are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platforms .
Thus , socialization can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms. Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
The society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interactions are transformed into cyber interactions .
With frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socializes through cyberspace will be more advanced , and adapted to the highly-connected world .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
We can not be certain for sure the reliability or truth of some posts or information we received through the Internet .
We may in fact be communicating with a hoax Facebook account of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real , but in reality , it is a fake account .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit a certain personal agenda .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction , which can be stimulated outside the media .
Although emoticons can be used to show certain emotions , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observe them through their body language and their facial expressions .
The danger of such media socialization is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behavior when communication is made through social media instead of meet-ups .
This lowers the experience of a human 's ability to interact with one another , which can adversely shape one 's behavior .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans will not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artist or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what is their friends ' recent activity .
Nevertheless , they still can use phones to do normal calls and messages to their contacts .
Not only did the phone do the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices which are able to connect to the Internet .
It is obvious to see that the Internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding social media actually having some inevitable disadvantages to people .
People can only use electrical devices to access the Internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or other Internet device .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
As a result , they will use eyes to contact and hands to express their feelings to people near them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face contact communicating .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
A family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
A group of friends having high tea in a café without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen .
The children nowadays do not know what is neighbourhood games and who is staying beside them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
These are some concrete examples of how the social media reduces face-to-face human contact .
When people get used to using social media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communicating skills will degrade and lost eventually .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , or even the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them do the jobs , but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media does have some other advantages besides their general benefits to human being .
First of all , people save money by using internet to contact other people and reading news .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via social media software instead of making international call which costs a lot to normal salary family .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are able to update their friends about his recent activity easily .
A guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that save work most of the time .
In conclusion , social media benefits people in several ways , but at the same time , harms people .
People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way .
With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
All of us are living in the technology realm society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
It started with the invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we traveled by ship and now we can use airplanes to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message , as we needed to post our letter ; now , we can use e-mail ( which stands for electronic message ) to send messages to our friends or even use our hand-phone to send our messages .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier , we can see that distance between ourselves and our loved ones are getting farther apart .
This is because , by the ease of technology such as airplanes , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies ; even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or careers in life .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook one of the media that we need .
Nevertheless , everything in life has positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will be discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends , even though we are away from them .
Social media sites ( such as Facebook ) has allowed us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
These approaches help the parents communicate with their children and know what kinds of activities their children have when they are overseas .
The social media is beneficial , as it connects you and your loved ones , even though you are separated by the distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family , but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools .
One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among the youngsters .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their Facebook page , as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concentrating when they supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This will , then , lead to stress , as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making the right decision .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the use of the social media platforms is a commonplace in our lives .
In increasingly globalized world , such platforms even enhance and complicate the links between individuals in the world .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing some social changes , whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individuals ' daily lives and , therefore , becoming a large problem in societies as a whole .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decreased .
As people feel more confident online , where they do not have to face others in real-life , they feel more comfortable and , thus , prefer communicating online .
This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students , as they always have the option to turn their back to real-life and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but to face things in real-life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realize how to interact with people in real-life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into the social media , the more they seek attention from their friends .
However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short-termed and gone easily ; thus , it does not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
Also , according to research , it has been proven that the users feel sadder after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
Social media definitely has some other benefits that make the users stay ; keeping the links among people is one .
Indeed , I use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
However , the friendship on such a virtual world is so superficial , which is not so relevant to the real-life .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond in which to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information of the users .
As this happens , users are more and more prone to any possible frauds .
Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real-life , they will not be indulged in it as much as they are now .
The users , soon , will realize that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform , like Facebook .
The parents are now the " friends '' of their kids , and they can now " follow '' their kids more closely and on real time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and at different settings .
We may meet only once , but we exchange our contact numbers as well as Facebook accounts , in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media ( like Facebook ) is a great way for friends from different fields , or even from different parts of the world , to be connected .
Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his/her updates .
On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the news feed .
This allows friends that may not have the time to meet up to still stay connected , in a way .
Not only that , new friends can easily be met through such online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is , indeed , expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that makes us fall apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is the reduced amount of face-to-face contact .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills which inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend to send birthday wishes when Facebook prompts us that , " today is someone 's birthday . ''
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send greeting cards during festive times like Chinese New Year , and it feels so good to write one and , of course , to receive one emblazoned with stamps .
Gone are the times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As time passed , we may have more " friends '' on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms , but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings , but social media sites are a tool to enhance it .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 percent of people play on social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people from around the world .
It consists of the functions of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages due to the social media which are concerning in the society .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life .
First , with the function of social media sites that connects the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place constraints .
Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over a thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without traveling to their countries .
It saves a lot of money and time ( as well as strengthening our relationship ) , although we stay at different places around the world .
Besides that , companies can also use the convenience of social media sites ( such as Facebook chat or Skype ) to facilitate the meeting with parties of projects from around the world .
Substantial costs are saved without the tiring travel from one point to another .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in the other sectors , which benefits companies more and boosts up the company 's profit .
However , there are two sides of stories always .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between humans .
Since ancient times , human interacted with others face by face .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills , '' that is the point of view in society .
Based on the statistical report , the more writing skills will be reduced , the more time used in the social media sites .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
The auto-correction software is so effective when using electronic devices that we do not realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill of a person who expresses their own feelings and opinions .
'Privacy ' , this is the word that popular in these few decades .
Humans have their own rights to privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news about the social media sites leaking users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Although it looks like there are no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by the government laws , but also spied upon by the government .
In conclusion , everything has two sides of the story .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize the technology well , we should do our effort to not only balance the pros and cons , but also lengthen the pros and shorten the cons .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our ( and our next ) generation .
With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Getting connected on social media , such as Facebook and Twitte , has become a trend as well as daily work .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life .
On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to contact with each other anytime and everywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media makes it possible to have interaction by writing comments .
When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
Some people who try to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people to update friends ' statuses and to make contact with friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to think about the influences brought by social media .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people life , people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting which has a time and place requirement .
People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved through this situation .
Secondly , people 's over-addition may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standards , as well as other show-off situations may make people 's daily lives more and more grandiloquent , which is not an accurate social growing trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may be still lasting for a long time .
Therefore , every time we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies are enhanced continuously .
Telephone may be perceived as the biggest innovation created ever when the first time Graham Bell introduced it .
However , since internet is better known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are given to the users .
Let us take example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particulars and address may change from time to time , while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the identifier .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting services , personal profile , media sharing , and other entertainment .
social games ) , which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and to express themselves at the same time .
Twitter , which has more simplified functions compared to Facebook , gives more benefits if used as information-sharing media .
Twitter only allows users to give updates that are limited to short sentences ; in order to spread the words fast , only highlighted messages are delivered .
For Facebook a comprehensive way of sharing is offered , since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook .
These advantages also come in handy , as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications in our smartphones .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize beforehand .
Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people who are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As a consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say , but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth may be not well arranged and is the picture of your personality .
This skill requires practice and can not be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting pictures in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
These social media sites serve a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries , but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before , that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget , not facing human being .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build " false image '' in public .
We tend to only share our happy moments in media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think of their-selves lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder .
It also reduces our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people .
As explained above , sophisticated modern technology does n't always provide an advantage .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize .
It is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
So we should never forget to think about -- and calculate the benefit and loss of -- every decision that we make .
Nowadays , advancements in technology improve countless lives every single day .
In most of the countries , there are emergency social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that the social media sites benefit the communication between people , while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .
One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who live far away , especially in villages , takes much time .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from a school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses ; we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter .
If by phone and by letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connections between ourselves and our old friends .
Hence , the social media sites serve as a platform for the connections .
Everything that comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts for the people and the society .
The advancement of those social media sites makes people so rely on them that some rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will , in turn , cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
As we all know , the interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in-touch with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
With an increasing number of users ( more than billion ) from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated , clearly , its success in playing an important part of our life .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which , in turn , affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and in society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All users require is an Internet connection and an email account , so everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their social media journey .
Secondly , it helps people keep in touch with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking everyone around in real life .
Social media helps lessen the difficulty of geographical distance , bringing people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , and it 's all reachable with one click of the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our globally inter-connected world .
However , social media sites also have their second side of negative impact on humans .
Undeniably , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time socializing and interacting virtually .
We spend a majority of our time on sites like Facebook and Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In the corporate world , employers often block access to social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on personal leisure rather than concentrating on their work .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also has a bad impact for us in the long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend on face-to-face interactions with one another .
Hence , it decreases valuable interaction between humans and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also false reports and fake IDs which occur on both social media sites. People use fake ID 's to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua which occurred recently on Facebook .
These malicious comments often go viral and it create a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In conclusion , everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo which have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , people may worry about the young generation having problems in face-to-face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions .
Social media enables us to explore the world far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one-week holiday .
The convenience is beyond description .
With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Moreover , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online , with their masks in reality being taken off .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University : in 2012 , 80 % of information posted online is true , while a person may be truthful only 3 out of 10 times in real life .
This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a Facebook account .
That is because we are acting as who we are in reality , while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes the genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as the prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh-sounding comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
People around the world could easily share thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions , where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots that happened in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
These social media sites may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .
For example , in 2012 general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Though because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias .
Intensive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people , sitting together around a table , each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends , and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lives .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thank to those social media sites , the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance , many other advantages , such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear , such as reduction in face-to-face human contact , which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view , it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays , many news publishers make their own social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its followers with headline news .
That shows how , actually , news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without the need to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start to do their business via these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can buy and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered an advantage for us , the buyers .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually , compared to when we meet them personally ?
I do think there is a difference in it , and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our true feelings and may not become ourselves , since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the 'tone ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online , but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to a bad inter-personal skills , as well as a problem with trust .
Nowadays , we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media , since we will never know whether they are even " real . ''
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people , or some may even cheat others .
In addition , privacy issues have become more popular since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider its drawbacks and , thus , use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and they disadvantage us in the smallest way possible .
It is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching their phones or wearing an earpiece in this modern society .
Not only one , but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution .
Social media sites , like Twitter and Facebook , are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects , such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills , which is important in their work place .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach others easily , even without contact for a long time .
In this fast pace and competitive world , people may not able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scene on it , and they can be updated about the new information of their friends .
Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Using a common social media site with my friends helps me know what are their statuses are nowadays .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In Singapore , many Malaysians crossed the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy with work , and separated from their children .
One of the managers in my workplace has the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People get connected or closer to others with the same preferences .
It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information .
Students can exchange their experiences in study , even when they are in different countries .
People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , therefore others can spread the joy with them .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one useful tool to help people know each other better .
However , social media sites are a double-sided sword ; it also brings in some negative effects on our daily life .
One of the disadvantages is that many people are concerned about is that people lose the interest of face-to-face communication .
Many people like to use language to pretend themselves , and lost confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relationships , even without the existence of the social media sites , we can not deny that it does affect some people 's interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalized world .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another .
Online friends became real life friends , and real life friends communicate with one another online .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this change .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas , stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening '' .
When we use facebook and post pictures and statuses .
We are actively " presenting '' facades of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks , status that are funny .
We broadcast these facades of ourselves to others .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking out for attention , rather than expressing one 's true opinion , on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are just scrolling down pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think is funny .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help forge interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing friendship requires the all-around understanding of one another and caring for one another .
The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to one another .
One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his or her Facebook page where he or she carefully chooses what to present .
One can not truly show their emotions to another by texting some " = ) '' signs .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures .
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends have horrible taste in clothes and he/she posts them often , I can simply block him/her off .
Information gets circulated .
The most popular information gets circulated the most so I can seldom miss it .
Social network plays a role in providing , and also filtering information .
This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social medias .
From the above two points of view , I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online forums with whom I share the same interests .
I also discover some of my friends ' interests which I find in common with myself , so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , and so on .
The communication does not focus on how we feel or say to each other but whatever is interesting , or the content .
In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships , from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself ; however , whether it is good or bad , we are still not sure .
It is just different .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
People who are living in the modern world really can not live without the social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults possess a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media makes people able to connect to one another more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for some those , sharing some parts of their lives , such as videos and photos on the social media sites becomes really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful '' meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is the need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones that live far away from them in the past .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just type in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And , people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which are convenient , especially when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
When one chats on those media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotional delivery , and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuation .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol ( which means laugh intensively ) and " asap '' ( which means as soon as possible ) .
People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become a big problem .
Social media also provides people a huge bunch of information about people and things that they are interested in .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore , like famous movie and series stars , business men and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their admirers ' lives and works .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time .
However , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites are honest .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate '' his or her face .
But , there is the possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
To sum it up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
And , it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites .
How does social media help change our lives ?
As the development of the technology , social media becomes a more and more significant role in the whole world .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better .
However , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it , at the same time , reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
Many people say they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are doing in other parts of the world .
This is especially true for people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything that happened in their home country , and the only way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information .
Nowadays , people can just as easily put their renting information on their Facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world , which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
It is quite significant , especially for those young teenagers , since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great number of people who are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing .
They pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
The more we care about facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see in some parties , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes us a lot of time as well .
Think in another way , if we reduce the time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely , rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life .
The advantage and disadvantage of social media
Nowadays , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
You can see people playing on Facebook and Twitter through their smartphones or iPads , on buses or on trains .
Some may say that the appearance of these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
First of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago , when these modern products were not popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people far away was still restricted to making phone calls , sending emails , or writing letters .
Some will take a long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their responses .
However , social media solves these problems well .
People can contact their friends on the Internet and get their reply very fast .
The communication is also not limited to words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
People can also get to know their friends ' states and moods by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations , and see the comments online , and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media make people 's lives much more colorful , and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's lives .
It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face-to-face , such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Some people spend a lot of time on it , and forget their real lives .
Actually , I have seen some people who are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
However , they behave quite boringly when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems to their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face-to-face .
Some may spend less and less time with their families and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double-edged sword .
It can make our life simpler .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through these social media .
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively their interpersonal skills .
Overall , the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages .
So , we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
Try to bypass the shortcomings .
Remember to send greetings to your friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
People can know their friends ' recent looks and interesting things happening to them just by checking their Facebook ( or other social media ) sites .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly make sure that old friends do not lose the information and the chance to communicate with you , even if you are in a different country .
However , the social media sites truly reduce the face-to-face communication which truly affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people 's daily life .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express .
For example , on Mother 's Day , people are shy to say " I love you '' to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion , and feel warm .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with his parents and friends .
Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Secondly , social media sites do not only connect people with their friends closely .
People can also know much information about celebrities in Twitter and Facebook - such as Obama and Bill Gates - and get first-hand study materials on it .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thoughts by using the social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who needs money to cure a disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information , his or her will share it to their " friends area '' , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing and not talking .
People even prefer talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Therefore , the social media truly limits the interpersonal skills , such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connecting between themselves and their friends .
Secondly , without the communication in real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and falsehoods .
There are many people in the social media with beautiful images and good content in their pages : however , in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated and lose money .
Therefore , the social media is not safe , which can be bad to teenagers ' future development .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people in many areas .
However , there exists some disadvantages , which will affect people to some degree .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily Life and Society .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media has become more popular , and even important , in our daily life .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook , and microblogs more and more frequently .
There is no need for people to go out of their homes to interact with others , they chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done or funny stories .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others by the social media , but the problems come out .
People do not know how to talk with each other face to face , especially the strangers .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media .
In old days , if one wanted to tell some important news to another who lived far away , he needed to write letters and it wasted time .
The long distance and time-consuming nature made spreading the messages very difficult .
Therefore , people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there was something important .
However , people now can contact anyone all over the world ( who can use a computer ) at any time , and there is no time delay of messages .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media .
If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
The information collected may not be true .

Though social media does create relationships , they are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
There is a story of a girl who lived in social media world every night for eight years .

It is not only convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business , but it can also damage peoples ' relationships and interpersonal skills .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potentials to the fullest .
